# MLS-Downloader
small tool to bulk download MLS property images

Created for my co-workers at Royal LePage to streamline downloading MLS images which we need to do from time to time.  Helpfully, MLS stores its images at a fixed URL with parameters for the MLS number and photo index, so this program simply takes an MLS number from the user and spits out all the associated images.

Uses tkinter for the GUI, so if anyone actually downloads this for some reason and it won't run, make sure it is installed. It comes with most python installations but see here if you're having issues https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html
